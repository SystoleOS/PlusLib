# PlusLib Fork for SystoleOS

**Note:** This is not the official [PlusLib](https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib) repository. This fork exists for the development and maintenance of PlusLib features and enhancements used in the SystoleOS project, with a particular focus on packaging PlusLib in Systole with minimal divergence.

## Purpose

The purpose of this fork is to facilitate the integration and packaging of PlusLib into SystoleOS and to provide a platform for SystoleOS-specific development. This repository also serves as an instrument for contributing back to the main PlusLib project, fostering a collaborative environment between the SystoleOS and PlusLib communities. The `master` branch in this repository is kept in high synchronization with the official PlusLib `master` branch.

## Branches

This repository contains the following branches:

- `master`: The master branch, synced with the official PlusLib `master` branch.
- `Systole-patches/PlusLib`: The branch for the PlusLib library, used for SystoleOS development, maintenance, and packaging.

## Collaboration

We encourage collaboration and contribution from both the SystoleOS and PlusLib communities. This repository aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, improvements, and bug fixes between both projects. If you have a contribution or a suggestion, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

When contributing to this repository, please follow the same [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) established by the official PlusLib project to ensure consistency and quality.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the PlusLib community for their dedication and hard work in creating and maintaining the PlusLib project. We also acknowledge the support from Oslo University Hospital and The Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which has made this project possible. We look forward to working together and contributing to the ongoing success and growth of the PlusLib ecosystem.
